Hadoop commands


To start with hadoop
>hadoop version
>start-dfs.sh
1.  Create a directory named by your name

>hadoop fs -mkdir /ullaas
>hadoop fs -ls /

2. Add two empty files into it

>hadoop fs -touchz /ullaas/one.txt
>hadoop fs -touchz /ullaas/two.txt

3. List all the files in the directory that you have created

>hadoop fs -ls /ullaas

4. Create one more directory by your usn and put that inside the directory of your name

>hadoop fs -mkdir /ullaas/1NT19IS179
>hadoop fs -ls /ullaas

5. Create a file in your local system by the name_usn.txt and add the contents as "Syntax 
to list Is command is hadoop fs -Is "

 >cat > ullaas_1NT19IS179.txt
 >"Syntax to list ls command is hadoop fs -ls"

►Put the file usn_name.txt in your hdfs directory called usn

>hadoop fs -touchz /ullaas/1NT19IS179/1NT19IS179_ullaas.txt
>hadoop fs -ls /ullaas/1NT19IS179

➤Put empty file of hdfs into the local file system

>hadoop fs -copyToLocal /ullaas/1NT19IS179/1NT19IS179_ullaas.txt
>ls

►Use mv command to move files from local file system and hdfs file system

>hadoop fs -mv /ullaas/two.txt /ullaas/1NT19IS179
>hadoop fs -ls /ullaas/1NT19IS179

▸ Experiment of cp command

>hadoop fs -cp /ullaas/one.txt /ullaas/1NT19IS179
>hadoop fs -ls /ullaas/1NT19IS179

► Display the total size of all the files in name directory

>hadoop fs -du /ullaas
>hadoop fs -du -s /ullaas

► Display each file size in usn directory Use stat command on name and usn directories

>hadoop fs -du /ullaas/1NT19IS179

➤ Illustrate the use of append command

cat > one.txt
Hello 
^Z
[4]+ Stopped cat > one.txt

>hadoop fs -appendToFile one.txt /ullaas/1NT19IS179/two.txt
>hadoop fs -cat /ullaas/1NT19IS179/two.txt
